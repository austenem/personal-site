Hi! I'm Austen, a software engineer based in Boston, MA. I enjoy building useful and beautiful things, especially when they help people. I recently graduated from Tufts University with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.F.A. in Fine Art. 

<br/>

I am currently a software developer at the [HIDIVE Lab](https://hidivelab.org/) at Harvard Medical School, where I primarily work on the [Human BioMolecular Atlas Project Data Portal](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/). Previously, I also worked at the [Harvard Division of Continuing Education](https://dce.harvard.edu/) as an EdTech software engineer, where I built tools to help improve learning experiences for asynchronous students.

<br/>

In my spare time, I enjoy oil painting, trying out ambitious recipes, and reading long fantasy novels. If you have or want recommendations for those last two, let me know :)
