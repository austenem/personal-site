Hi! I'm Austen, a software engineer based in Boston, MA. I enjoy making things. I recently graduated from Tufts University with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.F.A. in Fine Art. 

<br/>

I am currently a software developer at [Veson Nautical](https://veson.com/). Previously, I worked at the [HIDIVE Lab](https://hidivelab.org/) at Harvard Medical School and the [Harvard Division of Continuing Education](https://dce.harvard.edu/).

<br/>

In my spare time, I enjoy oil painting, trying out ambitious recipes, and reading long fantasy novels. If you have or want recommendations for those last two, let me know :)
